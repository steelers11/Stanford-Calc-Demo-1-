Stanford Course Calculator Assignment 1 
This is my implementation of the Calculator Demo Assignment 1 from Stanford's course online in iTunes U https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099
I only did the Clear, Decimal, and History buttons because of certain time restraints. 
I hope this is a good example for any classmates that are stumped on this part of the course. 
Please feel free to fork and edit! 
Also the history bar isnt working well with the new brain class the proffesur added. 
I will try and fix this soon.
